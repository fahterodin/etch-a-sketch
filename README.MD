This was pretty tricky for me. I stuck myself wanting to make the grid with flexbox, but I encounter so many problems with the new input that I had to drop it and use CSS grid, that made things 10 times more easy. 

Second I couldn't make the clear button work properly. I then started anew cause my code was getting really messy. I decided to peak at other people solution to understand how to make my code more readable and that really helped me a lot.

Overall I'm satisfied with the result but.
